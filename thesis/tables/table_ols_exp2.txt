\noindent \scriptsize{The regression analyzes the relationship between past experience (dependent var.) and future winning shares in the market (indep. var.).
The winning share is contracts bid / contracts won in the next two years. Experience is contracts won since the beggining of the sample, divided by number of years since the first win. 
The instrument for panels 2,3,5 and 6 is a binary indicator for a closely won contract among the past contracts won. Robust (HC1) error are on parethesis.} \end{minipage}}  \end{table}
